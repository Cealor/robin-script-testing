# Installation

Step 1: Install a userscript extension for your browser of choice such as Greasemonkey or Tampermonkey:

Firefox: [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)
Chrome: [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)


Step 2: Click this link to install the script:

https://github.com/Cealor/robin-script/raw/master/robinscript.user.js

If you get a bunch of code instead of it installing, you can copy and paste the code as a new script in greasemonkey/tampermonkey.
